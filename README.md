# Go by Example

Content and build toolchain for [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com),
a site that teaches Go via annotated example programs.

### Overview

The Go by Example site is built by extracting code and
comments from source files in `examples` and rendering
them via the `templates` into a static `public`
directory. The programs implementing this build process
are in `tools`, along with dependencies specified in
the `go.mod`file.

The built `public` directory can be served by any
static content system. The production site uses S3 and
CloudFront, for example.
