Welcome!
========

This is the home of Pygments.  It is a generic syntax highlighter suitable for
use in code hosting, forums, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
source code.  Highlights are:

* a wide range of over 300 languages and other text formats is supported
* special attention is paid to details that increase highlighting quality
* support for new languages and formats are added easily; most languages use a
  simple regex-based lexing mechanism
* a number of output formats is available, among them HTML, RTF, LaTeX and ANSI
  sequences
* it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
* ... and it highlights even Perl 6!

----------

Like every open-source project, we are always looking for volunteers to help us
with programming. Python knowledge is required, but don't fear: Python is a very
clear and easy to learn language.

Development takes place on `Bitbucket
<https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main>`_, where the Mercurial
repository, tickets and pull requests can be viewed.

Our primary communication instrument is the IRC channel **#pocoo** on the
Freenode network. To join it, let your IRC client connect to
``irc.freenode.net`` and do ``/join #pocoo``.

If you found a bug, just open a ticket in the Bitbucket tracker. Be sure to log
in to be notified when the issue is fixed -- development is not fast-paced as
the library is quite stable.  You can also send an e-mail to the developers, see
below.

The authors
-----------

Pygments is maintained by **Georg Brandl**, e-mail address *georg*\ *@*\ *python.org*.

Many lexers and fixes have been contributed by **Armin Ronacher**, the rest of
the `Pocoo <http://dev.pocoo.org/>`_ team and **Tim Hatch**.
