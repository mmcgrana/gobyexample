.SH DESCRIPTION
Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds
of software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to
prettify source code.
.PP
Its highlights are:
  * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
  * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
  * support for new languages and formats are added easily
  * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX and ANSI sequences
  * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
  * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!
.PP
\fBpygmentize\fP is a command that uses Pygments to highlight the input file and
write the result to \fI<outfile>\fP. If no \fI<infile>\fP is given, stdin is used.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-l \fI<lexer>\fP
Set the lexer name. If not given, the lexer is guessed from the extension of the
input file name (this obviously doesn't work if the input is stdin).
.TP
.B \-F \fI<filter>\fP[:\fI<options>\fP]
Add a filter to the token stream. You can give options in the same way as for
-O after a colon (note: there must not be spaces around the colon).
This option can be given multiple times.
.TP
.B \-f \fI<formatter>\fP
Set the formatter name. If not given, it will be guessed from the extension of
the output file name. If no output file is given, the terminal formatter will be
used by default.
.TP
.B \-o \fI<outfile>\fP
Set output file. If not given, stdout is used.
.TP
.B \-O \fI<options>\fP
With this option, you can give the lexer and formatter a comma-separated list of
options, e.g. "-O bg=light,python=cool". Which options are valid for which
lexers and formatters can be found in the documentation.
This option can be given multiple times.
.TP
.B \-P \fI<option=value>\fP
This option adds lexer and formatter options like the -O option, but
you can only give one option per -P. That way, the option value may contain
commas and equals signs, which it can't with -O.
.TP
.B \-S \fI<style>\fP
Print out style definitions for style \fI<style>\fP and for formatter \fI<formatter>\fP.
The meaning of the argument given by
.B \-a \fI<arg>\fP
is formatter dependent and can be found in the documentation.
.TP
.B \-L [\fI<which>\fP ...]
List lexers, formatters, styles or filters. Set \fI<which>\fP to the thing you want
to list (e.g. "styles"), or omit it to list everything.
.TP
.B \-H \fI<type>\fP \fI<name>\fP
Print detailed help for the object \fI<name>\fP of type \fI<type>\fP, where \fI<type>\fP is one
of "lexer", "formatter" or "filter".
.TP
.B \-h
Show help screen.
.TP
.B \-V
Show version of the Pygments package.
