// The primary mechanism for managing state in Go is
// communication over channels. We saw this for example
// with [worker pools](worker-pools). There are a few other
// options for managing state though. Here we'll
// look at using the `sync/atomic` package for _atomic
// counters_ accessed by multiple goroutines.

package main

import "fmt"
import "time"
import "sync/atomic"
import "runtime"

func main() {

	// We'll use an unsigned integer to represent our
	// (always-positive) counter.
	var ops uint64 = 0

	// To simulate concurrent updates, we'll start 50
	// goroutines that each increment the counter about
	// once a millisecond.
	for i := 0; i < 50; i++ {
		go func() {
			for {
				// To atomically increment the counter we
				// use `AddUint64`, giving it the memory
				// address of our `ops` counter with the
				// `&` syntax.
				atomic.AddUint64(&ops, 1)

				// Allow other goroutines to proceed.
				runtime.Gosched()
			}
		}()
	}

	// Wait a second to allow some ops to accumulate.
	time.Sleep(time.Second)

	// In order to safely use the counter while it's still
	// being updated by other goroutines, we extract a
	// copy of the current value into `opsFinal` via
	// `LoadUint64`. As above we need to give this
	// function the memory address `&ops` from which to
	// fetch the value.
	opsFinal := atomic.LoadUint64(&ops)
	fmt.Println("ops:", opsFinal)
}
