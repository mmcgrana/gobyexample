// [Timers](timers) are for when you want to do
// something once in the future - _tickers_ are for when
// you want to do something repeatedly at regular
// intervals. Here's an example of a ticker that ticks
// periodically until we stop it.

package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

    // Tickers use a similar mechanism to timers: a
    // channel that is sent values. Here we'll use the
    // `range` builtin on the channel to iterate over
    // the values as they arrive every 500ms.
    ticker := time.NewTicker(500 * time.Millisecond)
    go func() {
        for t := range ticker.C {
            fmt.Println("Tick at", t)
        }
    }()

    // Tickers can be stopped like timers. Once a ticker
    // is stopped it won't receive any more values on its
    // channel. We'll stop ours after 1600ms.
    time.Sleep(1600 * time.Millisecond)
    ticker.Stop()
    fmt.Println("Ticker stopped")
